// BookingService.cpp
// this is the class that actually runs the whole booking process -
// check seats, book them, calculate price, take payment, print ticket.
// also handles cancelling.
//
// important bit: this only ever talks to Payment (the abstract class), never
// to UpiPayment/CardPayment/CashPayment directly. that way if we add
// NetBankingPayment later we don't have to touch this file at all.
